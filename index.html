<div>Sometimes, the people we like don't like us back, </div>
<div>and it's painful, but there's nothing we can do about it.</div>
<div>I know what it's like when someone doesn't feel the same way about you.</div>
<div>Someone you can't stop thinking about. It hurts.</div>
<div>But you can't make people like you.</div>
<div>Love isn't about grand gestures, or the moon and the stars.</div>
<div>It's just dumb luck.</div>
<div>And sometimes, you meet someone who feels the same way.</div>
<div>And, sometimes, you're unlucky.</div>
<div>But one day, you're gonna meet someone who appreciates you for who you are.</div>
<div>There's seven billion people on the planet.</div>
<div>I know one of them is gonna climb up on a moon for you.</div>
